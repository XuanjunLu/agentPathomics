Analysis of differences in T_stage between high and low-risk groups
============================================================
Clinical feature: T_stage
Feature type: categorical

T_stage           1         2         3         4
group                                            
High risk  0.470588  0.270588  0.223529  0.035294
Low risk   0.558140  0.232558  0.209302  0.000000

Chi-square test results:
Chi-square statistic: 0.0461
p-value: 0.9974
Degrees of freedom: 3
Patients in the low-risk group tend to be in which category of T_stage? Conversely, patients in the high-risk group tend to be in which category of T_stage?
Tips: In GSEA, if ES > 0, the pathway is upregulated in high-risk patients and downregulated in low-risk patients.
